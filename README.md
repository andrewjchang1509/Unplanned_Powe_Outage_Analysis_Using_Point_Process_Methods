# Unplanned_Power_Outage_Analysis_Using_Point_Process_Methods
In this final project for Spatial Statistics course, some point process models were examined.
Although they did not yield promising result, through this project I practiced on:
1. Collecting the data from API with JSON format and read/write data in JSON/GeoJSON file.
2. Read in shape files.
3. Create map plot using geopandas/seabon/matplotlib packages.
